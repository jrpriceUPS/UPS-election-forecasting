**Introduction**

In looking at past polls and elections, the "bias" of a poll is defined around the margin of difference between the two primary candidates of a race. 

What is the relationship between that "bias" and the actual number of percentage points a particular poll is off in judging candidates in a vacuum? 

What is the relationship between Republican Error, Democratic error, and traditional bias with the following definitions?

$$DemocraticError = DemocraticCanditatePollingPercent-DemocraticActualPercentage$$

$$RepublicanError = RepublicanCanditatePollingPercent-RepublicanActualPercentage$$

$$Bias = MarginPoll - MarginActual$$

$$MarginPoll = DemocraticCanditatePollingPercent-RepublicanCanditatePollingPercent$$
$$MarginActual = DemocraticActualPercentage-RepublicanActualPercentage$$

Democratic and Republican year leans are shown below for comparsion.

![Democratic and Rebulican year leans plotted together.](Figures/YearLeansPartyErrors.png)

For matching points by year and pollster, the relationship between Democratic error and republican error does not look very strong....

![In fact the R squared values is less than 0.](Figures/PollsterBiasPartyErrors.png)

**Conclusion**

The relationships between Republican Error, Democratic error, and traditional bias are not as strong as we might initally think.
