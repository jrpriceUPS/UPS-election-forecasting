Pollsters are now doing a better job weighing by education-necessary because college grads are more likely to respond to phone calls - 20 percent to 46 percent.  Most state online polls aren’t representative enough to weigh by the census demographics - they lean too democratic. Biden does 3.1 percent better with online state pools that telephone surveys. Recalled vote weighing can be used to reduce error, but it also induces systematic bias. People who would not state who they voted for in 16’ were twice as likely to support Biden in 2020. Recalled vote weighing gives the democratic party advantage.}
