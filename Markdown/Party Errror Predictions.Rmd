## Introduction

In looking at election forecasting models, we can seek to interpret party error. As defined by:

$$DemocraticError = DemocraticCanditatePollingPercent-DemocraticActualPercentage$$

$$RepublicanError = RepublicanCanditatePollingPercent-RepublicanActualPercentage$$

How can we go about doing so? There are several variables but year, pollster, and the number of undecided voters being polled can certainly help predict the party error of a poll. Additionally, democratic error and rebulican error are correlated enough that we express either one as a function of another. See "Margin versus Party Error.Rmd" for development of these ideas.

With that in mind, we will seek to ultimately build a Bayesian model. First let's explore with Fisherian models. 

## Fisherian Models

```{r, include=FALSE}
mydata=read.csv("Data/raw-polls_538_cleaned.csv")
minPolls=30
myDataMyPollsters=  mydata[0,]
for(myPollster in unique(mydata$pollster))
{

  #subset to a dataset with just each pollster
  subpoll=subset(mydata, pollster==myPollster)

  #if that subset has more than thirty entries, use it:
  if(nrow(subpoll)>minPolls){
    #combine each of these subsets together
    myDataMyPollsters=rbind(myDataMyPollsters, subpoll)
  }
}


myDataFrame = myDataMyPollsters

myDataFrame$pollster = factor( myDataFrame$pollster)
myDataFrame$year = factor( myDataFrame$year)
Undecided = 100 - myDataFrame$cand1_pct - myDataFrame$cand2_pct
myDataFrame$undecided = Undecided



Model1 = lm(repBias ~ demBias*year + undecided, data=myDataFrame)
summary(Model1)


Model2 = lm(repBias ~ demBias*year + demBias*pollster + undecided, data=myDataFrame)
summary(Model2)

Model3 = lm(repBias ~ demBias*year*pollster + undecided, data=myDataFrame)
summary(Model3)

tab_model(Model1,Model2, Model3, file="Simulations/UndecidedTrad.html")


```

```{r}
htmltools::includeHTML("Simulations/UndecidedTrad.html")
```

## Bayesian Modeling 

In this example of Bayesian modeling, year and pollster were used as nominal predictors for democratic bias and republican bias was modeling with the two numeric variables of modeled democratic bias and the number of undecided voters. 

The summary for this model is provided below:

```{r}
Summ=read.csv("Simulations/Jags-PartyErrorPredictorPractice-SummaryInfo.csv")
knitr::kable(Summ)
```
