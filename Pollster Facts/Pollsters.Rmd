## SurveyUSA
* 538 Rating: A
* Methodology in general
    - Sometimes 100% by telephone; in some cases, 100% online; and in other cases, a blend of the two. 
    - Landlines are interviewed using both live interviews and prerecorded robo-calls.
    - The youngest male is requested on approximately 30% of calls to home phones, the youngest adult is requested on approximately 70% of calls. 
* How do they define likely / registered voter?
    - Asks respondents if they are registered voters
    - Likely classification depends on survey (2 reoccurring cases)
        1. Asks respondents if they are certain to vote, certain to not, unlikely, or likely to vote. Likely voters  were categorized as only those that responded "100% certain to vote". "Probably will vote" responses were not considered likely voters." Ex: <http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=4b9bd0e5-3f07-4da9-b86f-370c0255240e>
        2. Of a poll that asks if they will vote... likely voters were categorized as those that responded "almost certain","100% certain", "already returned ballot" Ex: <http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=61197540-a792-49f0-9889-4dca5ad251ee>
* How do they do weighting? (before / after reporting results)
    - responses are minimally weighted to U.S. Census targets or voter file targets for gender, age and race. Cell (target) weighting is used.
