## Linear Modeling

To better understand polls, we can attempt to model the bias from polls with other measurable variables. 

```{r}
#load the data
#in this case from 538
mydata <- read.csv("raw-polls_538.csv")
```

Choose what years you would like to consider:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Establish which years you wish to use data from (between 1998 and 2020):
earlyYear=1998
lateYear=2020
```

Choose the minimum number (at least 50) of polls you wish a pollster to have before they are considered in the model:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
minPolls=100
```
